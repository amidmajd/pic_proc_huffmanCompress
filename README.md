# Picture Compression Using HUFFMANcompress Algorithm
This code will compress a gray-scale picture with Huffman algorithm


# Requirements:
Python 3.6
<br>pip install -r requirements.txt

# How it works :
Image address as Input. 
<br>if the image wasn't in gray-scale mode ,program would convert it to gray-scale and Compress it in huffman-Code.
